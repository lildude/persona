This plugin brings Mozilla's Persona (https://login.persona.org/) to Habari and allows you to allow users to login using Persona or just verify their comments.

NOTE: This plugin is incomplete. Only logging in works at the moment. Mozilla has put Persona development on the back-burner and so have I (before I got around to actually finishing everything :trollface:).
